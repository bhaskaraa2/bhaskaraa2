Five years ago, I was building Web Catalogue systems under Iceland's midnight sun. Countless nights of coding, architecting, and problem-solving taught me invaluable lessons about resilience and innovation.
After a decade with my previous employer, their bankruptcy became my catalyst for change.
Then came a bold decision - relocating to India with limited resources but unlimited determination. I founded Valstack, focusing on democratizing technology through No-Code solutions.

Today, after successfully serving clients for 3+ years as consultant and continue to building long product development for Valstack, I'm opening my calendar for new challenges.

What I've Mastered Along the Way:

- Turning complex technical research into actionable solutions
- Optimizing cloud architectures that save thousands in costs
- Streamlining Kubernetes deployments for better efficiency
- Building automated CI/CD pipelines that actually work
- Implementing agile practices that deliver results
- Integrating Cloud AI technologies (LLMs, Agents)

ðŸŽ¯ Looking to collaborate with teams who need:

- A technical partner who's been through the trenches
- Someone who can translate complexity into simplicity
- Experience-backed solutions to challenging problems

Why this matters: In today's tech landscape, you don't need to reinvent the wheel - you need someone who's already navigated the road.
