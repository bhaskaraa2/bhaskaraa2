State of UI in Rust

- Rust UI ecosystem is diverse, similar to web frontend
- Key capabilities: windowing, rendering, layout, text handling, input, accessibility
- Win-it library improving windowing support
- Rendering options: software, OpenGL, Vulkan/Metal/DirectX12, WGPU, Skia, WebRender
- Text rendering challenges: WebRender, Swash, Cosmic Text
- Layout strategies: flexbox/grid, stretch/fill, constraint-based
- Input handling, especially IME, needs improvement
- Trend towards declarative, reactive UI frameworks (e.g. Dioxus, Leptos, iced)
- Areas needing work: accessibility, automation, documentation, compile times
- Promising ecosystem, but gaps remain compared to mature frameworks

The Good, the Bad, and the Async

- Async Rust enables high-capacity servers and microservices
- Blocking I/O is simple but inefficient
- Non-blocking I/O with busy waiting wastes CPU
- Event polling is better but low-level and complex
- Rust's async/await and futures provide higher-level abstraction
- Futures types: normal, dumb, and Lea (interacts with runtime)
- Rust runtime: scheduler (tasks) and reactor (event poll)
- Runtime provides async TCP listener and stream
- Keep futures small, avoid self-references for performance/safety

Console Based UI in RUST

- TUIs: text-based interfaces, efficient alternative to GUIs
- Use ANSI escape sequences for advanced terminal control
- Popular libraries: ncurses, CDK, Ratatui (Rust-based)
- Ratatui: lightweight, customizable, flexible TUI framework
- Features: alternate screen, event handling, rendering modes
- Rust: memory safe, performant, cross-platform
- TUIs advantageous for efficiency, resources, accessibility
- Various applications: games, file managers, monitoring tools
- Active Ratatui community maintaining and improving library
- Growing ecosystem of Rust-based TUI tools and libraries
