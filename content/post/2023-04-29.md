Through this post, I want to present my experience as a developer and how I can
gain knowledge and succeed through open source.

What is open source?

Suppose, You write a piece of source code or any work. You are the author of
that work. No one can use that source without your permission.(But they can
recreate with the observation :-) ) You can gain benefits for yourself, and you
can sell that work as a license or provide service based on that work.

Initial stages of IT Industry, Most companies earn revenue by licensing the
product to users.

This approach changed through
[Free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition#The_Four_Essential_Freedoms_of_Free_Software)
to gain the freedom to able run, study, modify and share copies of work.

Suppose you started a career in the software development industry and are an
entry-level developer, then you can gain knowledge through the following two
ways.

1. As a consumer of Open Source to study the work
2. As a contributor to open-source projects

According to your personal goals, you can choose any option or both. Through my
observations and some references, some people contributed to open source and
landed to the company in key roles, starting their own company

Here are some references about contributors and ideas on the path.

Here are a few references to use open source to understand concept

1. How to write test cases (Here is an example of react test case
   https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1f7a2f577bc9e0264256d834d3daffbd7d6618f9/packages/react-dom/src/**tests**/ReactRenderDocument-test.js)
2. How to write git commit (Example:
   https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)
3. Write requirements (Example
   https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-error-inspection.md)
4. How to organize projects (Example for Golang
   https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

If you are an entry-level software developer, consider creating one developer
profile, publishing your learning, and improving existing work to gain knowledge
and build the network to create career opportunities and be proud of your work.
