I'm humbled to receive an appreciation letter from PMI (Project Management Institute) as part of International Volunteer Day celebrations.
While I feel my contributions this year have been modest or limited, my long-standing association with PMI and initial days at PMI Chennai Chapter has been an incredible learning journey. Through this association, I've gained invaluable insights into leadership and collaboration.
The PMI resources, courses, and webinars have been instrumental in helping me understand emerging trends and learn from distinguished leaders in the field.
Grateful for this recognition and looking forward to contributing more meaningfully to the PMI community and support your projects success.
